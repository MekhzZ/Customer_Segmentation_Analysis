# Customer_Segmentation_Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic data using K-means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Customer segmentation allows businesses to better understand their customer base, tailor marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Structure

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and transforming categorical variables.
- Modeling: Applied the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct segments based on their behavior.
- Evaluation: Used elbow method and silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Results: Visualized the clusters using various charts to show how different customer segments were formed.

## Key Features\

- K-means clustering: Used to group customers with similar attributes.
- Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations for the clusters using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Customer Profiles: Provided summaries of the key characteristics for each customer segment, helping identify high-value customers or other distinct groups.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning and clustering
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization

## Insights
- The clusters provide meaningful insights into different customer behaviors.
- The segmented customers can be used for targeted marketing strategies.
